     World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web)<strong></a> is an information space where documents
     and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked
     by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist

     computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.The Web browser was
     released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991
     and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.</p>
